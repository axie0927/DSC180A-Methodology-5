## Quarter 2 Project Brainstorming Prompts

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter would be the investigation of different parameters used. 

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
Potential investigation would be to utilize regression techniques to build a model to predict whether a waveform is a signal or not.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I would have perhaps utilized the data to create more parameters of my own instead of just creating the ones we are told to create.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I am interested in using deep learning models as we have a lot of data to work with.
